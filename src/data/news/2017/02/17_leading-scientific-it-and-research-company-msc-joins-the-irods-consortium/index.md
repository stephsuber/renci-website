CHAPEL HILL, NC – Medical Science and Computing, LLC (<a href="http://www.mscweb.com/#science-technology-1">MSC</a>), a company that provides scientific information technology and research services to the federal health and life sciences community, has joined the growing membership of the iRODS Consortium, the membership-based foundation that leads development and support of the integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS).<!--more-->

MSC provides IT solutions and biomedical research services to federal agencies involved in health and life sciences research, including the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. MSC’s services are integrated into some of the federal government’s largest biomedical and clinical research and big data management initiatives. The company provides highly specialized support to mission-critical programs that use cutting-edge technologies and applications to accelerate scientific discovery.

As members of the iRODS Consortium, MSC will incorporate iRODS into the innovative technical solutions it offers to the federal health and life sciences research community and will offer insights from that community to inform the continued development of iRODS.

“Our customers look to us for solutions that frame how we research, collaborate, and innovate in order to drive future advancements in research,” said Aaron Pendola, MSC Solution Development Center lead. “The innovative technical characteristics of iRODS align with demonstrated successes from our work, and the spirit of the iRODS Consortium aligns with the collaborative nature of the scientific discovery process. MSC will be a key partner to both the Consortium and the federal scientific community to drive the future of research at the intersection of science and technology.”

“MSC knows the data management needs of the health and life sciences research community, and we intend to work with them closely to understand those needs,” said iRODS Consortium Executive Director Jason Coposky. “This is an opportunity for the iRODS open source data management platform to help MSC accelerate discoveries in health, medicine, and life sciences, and we welcome that opportunity with enthusiasm.”

In addition to MSC, current iRODS Consortium include Bayer, Dell/EMC, DDN, HGST, IBM, Intel, the National Institute for Computational Science at the University of Tennessee, Panasas, RENCI, Seagate, University College London, Utrecht University, and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.
