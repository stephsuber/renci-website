CHAPEL HILL, NC –  The National Consortium for Data Science (NCDS), a public-private partnership to advance data science and capitalize on the opportunities of a data-rich society, seeks participants for its 2017 – 2018 Data Fellows program.<!--more-->

The Data Fellows program provides funding to faculty members from NCDS academic member institutions to support research on novel and innovative data science and data-focused business problems. NCDS academic members include all campuses in the University of North Carolina system and Drexel University. The program is open to faculty researchers in all disciplines and domains, with preference given to junior faculty with no more than five years of service. This year, the NCDS will award two fellowships of up to $30,000 each.

In an effort to promote research initiatives that align with the mission and goals of the NCDS, a list of possible research topics has been included in the call for proposals. Submissions that do not fit into one of the identified research themes will be considered if they address particularly innovative or important data science research questions.

Data Fellows proposals must be submitted by 5 p.m. Friday, April 7, 2017. All who submit proposals will be notified of their status by April 21, 2017. The one-year fellowships will begin on approximately July 3, 2017. Proposals should be no more than four (4) pages, should be understandable to readers from outside the field of study, and must clearly spell out the expected benefits of collaborating with the NCDS.
