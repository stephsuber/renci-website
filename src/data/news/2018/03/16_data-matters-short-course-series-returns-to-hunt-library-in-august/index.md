<strong> </strong>We live in a data-driven world, and as researchers, business professionals, and government policymakers struggle to stay on top of the latest data science trends and practices, the Data Matters™ Short Course Series returns to offer a week full of education and training. <!--more-->

Now in its fifth year, Data Matters 2018 takes place August 13 – 17 at the James B. Hunt Library on North Carolina State University’s Centennial Campus. The short course series is sponsored by the <a href="http://datascienceconsortium.org/">National Consortium for Data Science </a>(NCDS),  the <a href="http://odum.unc.edu/">Odum Institute</a> for Research in Social Science at UNC Chapel Hill,  North Carolina State University, and <a href="http://www.renci.org/">RENCI</a>. UNC’s Davis Library is providing additional support for the series this year.

Data Matters offers two-day courses on Monday and Tuesday and Thursday and Friday, and one-day courses on Wednesday. Topics to be covered this year include beginning, intermediate, and advanced uses of the R software environment, information visualization, data mining, machine learning, introduction to Python, text analysis in R, and network analysis. Instructors are all experts in their fields from NC State University, UNC-Chapel Hill, UNC Greensboro, Duke University, and Cisco.

Data Matters offers reduced pricing for faculty, students, and staff from academic institutions and for professionals with nonprofit organizations.  Head to the <a href="http://datamatters.org/">Data Matters website </a>to register and to see detailed course descriptions, course schedules, instructor bios, and logistical information.
