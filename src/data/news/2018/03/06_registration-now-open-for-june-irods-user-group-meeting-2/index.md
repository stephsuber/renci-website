DURHAM, NC - Users of the integrated Rule Oriented Data System (iRODS) will come to Durham, NC from points around the globe to attend the 2018 iRODS User Group Meeting (UGM) June 5 – 7.

<!--more-->

The meeting gives iRODS users and those interested in using iRODS the chance to learn about the latest updates to iRODS software, hear about iRODS implementations from users in different research domains and business sectors, discuss iRODS-enabled applications and discoveries, and glimpse the future of iRODS and the iRODS Consortium.

Thousands of businesses, research centers, and government agencies located in the U.S., Europe, Asia, Australia, South America, and Africa use iRODS for flexible, policy-based open source data management that provides long-term preservation and federation.

The 10th annual iRODS UGM begins Tuesday, June 5 with optional training sessions aimed at beginner and advanced iRODS users. The UGM formally kicks off Wednesday, June 6 and will feature more than 25 presentations from the user community and the core development team, including use cases, live demonstrations, and open discussions about requested iRODS features.  Organizers anticipate more than 150 users will participate in the meeting representing dozens of academic, commercial, and government institutions.

Attendees will have the chance to present their iRODS stories in a variety of ways:
<ul>
 	<li>20-minute presentations that explain a novel iRODS application or development</li>
 	<li>40-minute talks/demonstrations that offer an explanation of an iRODS use case along with a live demonstration of the technology.</li>
</ul>
Those interested in presenting at the meeting must submit an abstract by April 1. Presenters are also encouraged to submit a paper for publication in the formal Proceedings of the iRODS User Group Meeting 2018, which will be made available as a PDF and on Amazon. All papers must be submitted by June 1.
