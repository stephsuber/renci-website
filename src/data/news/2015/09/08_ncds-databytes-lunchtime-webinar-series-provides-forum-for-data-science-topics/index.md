April 2015 marked the start of the new National Consortium for Data Science (NCDS) DataBytes Lunchtime Webinar Series. Launched as an opportunity to discuss the most interesting issues and ideas in data science, the series gives NCDS members and the broader data science community a chance to delve into a new topic each month.

The last three webinars of the year feature NCDS Data Fellows. In September's talk, David Gotz, PhD, of UNC Chapel Hill's School of Information and Library Science, delved into his research on visualization of large-scale temporal data.

The next webinar in the series is scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 6 at noon EDT. The talk will

feature Erik Saule, PhD, of UNC Charlotte. Saule will discuss his research toward developing a framework for performing efficient graph analysis regardless of the type of analysis being performed or the computer system used.

The concluding webinar in this year's DataBytes series will take place on Wednesday, Nov. 4 and will highlight the work of Erjia Yan, PhD, of Drexel University. Yan is working to develop a system that will comprehensively capture the impact of data and software on knowledge production and discovery.

DataBytes webinars are generally held the first Wednesday of each month, and all webinars are easily accessible from the <a href="http://data2discovery.org/">NCDS home page</a>.

This year’s line-up featured presentations from representatives of RTI International, Cisco, GE, and Deloitte in addition to the NCDS 2015 <a href="http://data2discovery.org/data-fellows/">Data Fellows</a>. Topics have ranged from general overviews, such as Russ Gyurek’s (Cisco) talk on the Internet of Things, to more specific presentations like Bill Wheaton’s (RTI) discussion of synthetic populations in the healthcare realm.
