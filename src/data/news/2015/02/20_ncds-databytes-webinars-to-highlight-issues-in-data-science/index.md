The <a href="http://data2discovery.org/databytes-webinars/" target="_blank">DataBytes series</a> webinars will take place on or about the first Wednesday of each month. Talks will begin at noon, last 30 to 45 minutes, be followed by Q and A, and will conclude no later than 1 p.m.

The first webinar focuses on the Internet of Everything (IoE) and features Russ Gyurek of Cisco as the presenter. The Internet of Everything is defined as the intelligent connectivity of physical devices to drive massive gains in efficiency, business growth, and quality of life. It promises to transform society as dramatically as the commercial Internet and widespread electric power once did. Key ingredients that will lead to a transformative IoE include devices and sensors, networking to connect them to each other and to people, and (perhaps most important) technologies to manage and glean knowledge from massive amounts of data.

The talk will look at the grand challenges associated with turning the Internet of Everything from the hottest buzz phrase in data science and big data into a reality that can revolutionize healthcare, government, transportation, and business operations.
