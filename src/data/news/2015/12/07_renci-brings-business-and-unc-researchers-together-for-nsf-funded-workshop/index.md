businesses, and program officers with the National Science Foundation met Dec. 2 and 3 at RENCI to discuss collaborative research opportunities and partnerships aimed at translating academic research into competitive value for business. The workshop focused on establishing a new research site at Carolina of an NSF-funded <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/home.jsp" target="_blank">Industry/University Cooperative Research Center </a>(I/UCRC) called the <a href="http://www.nsfcvdi.org/" target="_blank">Center for Visual and Decision Informatics</a> (CDVI). Based at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, CDVI already has research sites at <a href="http://drexel.edu/cci/research/centers-institutes/CVDI/" target="_blank">Drexel University</a> in Philadelphia and <a href="http://www.tut.fi/en/about-tut/news-and-events/tut-joins-the-nsf-center-devoted-to-challenges-of-big-data-p094392c2" target="_blank">Tampere University of Technology</a> in Finland.Â </span></p>

Researchers who attended the workshop represented the schools of Medicine, Public Health, Information and Library Science, and Business as well as RENCI and the departments of Statistics and Operations Research, and City and Regional Planning. Representatives of Quintiles, Intel, AllScripts, IntraHealth International, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina also attended.</span></p>
