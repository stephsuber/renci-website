<p><em>$4 million will support continued innovation and problem-solving in the Southern data science community</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The
National Science Foundation (NSF) recently announced the second phase
of funding for the regional Big Data Innovation Hubs (Hubs). Each of
the Hubs will receive $4 million over four years for a total
investment of $16 million. 
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each Hub is located in one of the four U.S. Census regions (South, Northeast, Midwest, and West) and serves as a thought leader and convening force on social and economic challenges that are unique to the region by playing four key roles: (1) Accelerating public-private partnerships that break down barriers between industry, academia, and government, (2) Growing R&amp;D communities that connect data scientists with domain scientists and practitioners, (3) Facilitating data sharing and shared cyberinfrastructure and services, and (4) Building data science capacity for education and workforce development.</p>

<p>“Developing
innovative, effective solutions to grand challenges requires linking
scientists and engineers with local communities,” said Jim Kurose,
assistant director for Computer and Information Science and
Engineering at NSF. “The Big Data Hubs provide the glue to achieve
those links, bringing together teams of data science researchers with
cities, municipalities, and anchor institutions.”</p>

<h4><strong>Solutions
for the Southern Region</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Led
jointly by the Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) at UNC-Chapel
Hill and the Georgia Institute of Technology, the South Hub focuses
their primary efforts on the Southern Region, which consists of 16
states - from Texas to Delaware - and the District of Columbia with
more than 1000 members from universities, corporations, foundations,
and cities. 
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The
South Hub’s priority areas include data science education and
workforce, data sharing and cyberinfrastructure, health and health
disparities, materials and advanced manufacturing, and smart cities
and communities. The environment, social cybersecurity, and team
science serve as cross-cutting areas of interest driving connection
and research in the Southern Region. 
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"The
Big Data Hubs provide a connective tissue for the data science
ecosystem across sectors and domains,” said Renata Rawlings-Goss,
executive director of the South Hub. “I am deeply pleased by NSF's
recommitment to the growth of the South Hub and our community. Over
the last three years, we have made great strides within our priority
areas and are looking to broaden that reach in the next four years."</p>

<p>In
addition to serving as a connector through the organization of
working groups and events, the Hubs also sponsor research important
to their regions through the Big Data Spokes program. Previous <a href="https://southbigdatahub.org/spoke-projects/">South
Hub Spoke projects</a>
have improved data science infrastructure, facilitated information
exchange across sectors, and enhanced access to research data in a
range of areas. Current Southern Spokes are focused on enhanced 3-D
mapping for coastal and wetland areas, smart privacy for smart
cities, and integrating biological big data research into student
training and education.

<p>"Data
science is having a transformative effect on the entire scientific
community,” said Stan Ahalt, principal investigator for the South
Hub. “Our Hub enables us to leverage data science expertise in
order to have an impact for good throughout the entire southeast
region."</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This
new phase of funding will also incorporate a seed fund focusing on
translational data science, which will allow each Hub to pilot
innovative new solutions to grand challenges important to each Hub’s
region.
