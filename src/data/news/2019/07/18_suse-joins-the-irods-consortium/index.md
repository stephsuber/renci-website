<p>The <a href="https://irods.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iRODS Consortium</a>, the foundation that leads development and support of the integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS) data management software, welcomes <a href="https://www.suse.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SUSE</a> as its newest Consortium member.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>iRODS is open source storage data management software for data discovery, workflow automation, secure collaboration, and data virtualization. By creating a unified namespace and a metadata catalog of all the data and users within a storage environment, the iRODS rule engine allows users to automate data management.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>iRODS easily integrates with SUSE Enterprise Storage, powered by Ceph technology, enabling users to take control of their data, regardless of  where and on what device the data is stored by integrating multiple storage tiers into a single storage cluster. As the newest iRODS  Consortium member, SUSE will help direct the technology and governance of iRODS and will participate in the development and testing of the  software, which is used by research and business organizations around the globe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“SUSE has a rich history of Linux distribution and open source support, and  partnering with them will allow iRODS to make even deeper connections  throughout the open source community,” said Jason Coposky, Executive Director, iRODS Consortium. “SUSE Enterprise Storage integrated with iRODS’ data management capabilities creates a compelling and comprehensive solution stack.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alan Clark, SUSE CTO Office lead focused on Industry Initiatives and Emerging Standards and chairman of the OpenStack Foundation board of directors, said, “SUSE
 is excited to join the iRODS Consortium, lending our open source 
technical expertise to help advance the iRODS data management software. 
The integration with SUSE Enterprise Storage helps customers lower total
 cost of ownership, leveraging commodity hardware to support their iRODS-managed storage environments.
 As a leading provider of open source software, SUSE helps our customers
 leverage the latest open source technologies for application delivery 
and software-defined infrastructure. SUSE tests and hardens our 
solutions, ensuring they are enterprise ready and backed by our superior support experience.”&nbsp;</p>
