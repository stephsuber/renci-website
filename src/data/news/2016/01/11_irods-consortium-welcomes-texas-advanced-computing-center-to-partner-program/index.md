<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CHAPEL HILL, NC, January 11, 2016 - The <a href="https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">Texas Advanced Computing Center</span></a> (TACC), a facility that provides scientists with some of the world’s most powerful computing resources to enable discoveries, is the latest organization to join the iRODS Partner Program, the <a href="http://irods.org/consortium/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">iRODS Consortium</span></a> announced today. <!--more--> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The iRODS Partner Program connects people who have data management challenges with organizations that can help solve them. All iRODS Partners have extensive experience with iRODS, the integrated Rule Oriented Data System, as deployed in production environments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">TACC, based at The University of Texas at Austin, designs, deploys and operates a wide range of high performance computing systems used by thousands of scientists each year to study problems in biology, medicine, environmental sciences, nanomaterials, astrophysics and much more.  iRODS, free open source data management software used by research and business organizations around the globe, is an important component of the services TACC provides through its Corral data management system and the Wrangler system, a computing environment for data-intensive applications provided though the National Science Foundation’s <a href="https://www.xsede.org/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">XSEDE</span></a> initiative.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“TACC uses iRODS to support research data management, dissemination, and reporting activities which are increasingly crucial to the research enterprise, and with the Wrangler system, we expect to be at the forefront of development and deployment of exciting new capabilities based on the iRODS technology and associated software products,” said Chris Jordan, manager of the Data Management and Collections group at TACC. “As such we are excited to be a part of the iRODS Partner Program. We appreciate the opportunity to learn from and to share experiences with other institutions using iRODS in similar capacities, and to help those who may just be getting started with research data management and iRODS to learn this exciting technology.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">TACC joins <a href="http://www.daystrom.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">Daystrom Technology Group</span></a>, <a href="http://www.distributedbio.com/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">Distributed Bio</span></a> and <a href="http://www.mtna.us/?page_id=2668" target="_blank"><span class="s2">Metadata Technology North America</span></a> as members of the iRODS Partner Program, which was launched in July 2015.  In addition to the Partner Program, the iRODS Consortium provides support to users through its engineering staff, particularly for cases that require advanced interaction with the iRODS code base. The iRODS Partner Program expands on these support capabilities with options for domain-specific and enterprise-grade service.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“TACC is an exciting addition to the Partner Program,” said Dan Bedard, executive director of the iRODS Consortium. “With years of iRODS experience, they already support a number of important production-level deployments that manage substantial amounts of research data. TACC is a world-class center with a reputation for responsive, effective user support.  Researchers from a broad range of scientific domains can be assured they will have the support and assistance they need by working with our partners at TACC.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The iRODS Partner Program has two levels of participation. Gold partners are Consortium members, and they provide support that leverages training and fallback assistance from Consortium staff. Standard partners, including TACC, have registered with the Consortium as solution and service providers with iRODS experience.
