Users of the integrated Rule Oriented Data System (iRODS) from around the globe will gather in Chapel Hill in June to discuss iRODS-enabled applications and discoveries, technologies powered by iRODS, and the future of iRODS and the iRODS Consortium.

The week of activities begins Tuesday, June 7 with one-day workshops aimed at beginner and advanced iRODS users. The iRODS User Group Meeting (UGM) will follow on June 8 and 9. Registration for both the workshops and the UGM runs through May 27 and early bird discounts are available through April 22.  Participants can register for both the UGM and a workshop or the UGM only. To register visit <a href="http://irods.org/ugm2016/" target="_blank"><span class="s2">http://irods.org/ugm2016/</span></a>.

The UGM is expected to bring as many as 200 iRODS users from industry, academia, and government to Chapel Hill, home of the iRODS development team and the iRODS Consortium, to meet other users and consortium members, hear presentations and use cases, and participate in demonstrations and discussions about requested iRODS features. The two workshops will focus on planning, deploying, and using iRODS 4.2 for both beginner and advanced users.

iRODS users are invited to submit proposals for 20-minute talks, 40-minute demonstrations, and posters. Presenters must submit an abstract by March 28. Presenters who plan to submit a paper with their presentation will receive favorable consideration when abstracts are evaluated. For more on presentations, see the <span class="s2">presentation guidelines</span> on the iRODS website.

Thousands of businesses, research centers, and government agencies located in the U.S., Europe, Asia, Australia, South America, and Africa use iRODS for flexible, policy-based data management that provides long-term preservation and federation. The iRODS Consortium launched in 2013 to support the continued development of iRODS as free open source software.
