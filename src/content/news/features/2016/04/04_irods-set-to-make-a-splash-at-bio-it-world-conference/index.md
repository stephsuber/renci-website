 	<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>EMC MetaLnx v1.0:</b> EMC MetaLnx is an open-source web application developed to capture, manage and apply metadata to research data collections. It works alongside iRODS and provides an intuitive graphical interface that supports iRODS administrative actions, collection management, and metadata management without requiring users to memorize individual iCommands.</span></li>
 	<li class="li1"><b></b><span class="s1"><b>iRODS 4.1 with Cloud Browser 1.1:</b> First released in May 2015 and updated several times since then with new plugins and features, iRODS 4.1 represents a significant step forward for iRODS technology by incorporating a new set of fundamental features and bug fixes. Cloud Browser is an easy-to-use interface for iRODS developed in collaboration with the <a href="http://datafed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DataNet Federation Consortium</a>, a National Science Foundation project that develops data management infrastructure for research communities.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“People attending Bio-IT World will have plenty of opportunities to learn how iRODS is being integrated into storage platforms and how it can be used to manage and share biomedical data while keeping it safe,” said iRODS Consortium Director Dan Bedard. “We invite all attendees to visit us and the other iRODS Consortium members at Bio-IT World this week.”</span></p>
