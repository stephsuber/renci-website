<strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-15403" src="https://renci.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/panasas.png" alt="" width="338" height="130" />SUNNYVALE, Calif., – April 26, 2016 </strong>– <a href="http://www.panasas.com/" target="_blank">Panasas</a><sup>®</sup>, the leader in performance scale-out network-attached storage (NAS), today announced that it has joined the <a href="http://irods.org/" target="_blank">iRODS Consortium</a> as a contributing member. The iRODS Consortium leads development and support of the Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS), free open source software for data discovery, workflow automation, secure collaboration, and data virtualization. The consortium and the iRODS development team are located at the Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI) at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.



The world's top researchers in life sciences, geosciences, and information management use iRODS to control their data in thousands of locations worldwide. Panasas will contribute insights into performance scale-out NAS requirements for supporting instrumentation and bioinformatics workloads.

"We look forward to the addition of Panasas and their performance scale-out NAS platform to the iRODS ecosystem," said Dan Bedard, director of the iRODS Consortium. "As the newest iRODS Consortium member and already an enthusiastic contributor to the iRODS technology base, Panasas will play a valuable and exciting role in the continued evolution of iRODS data management and the iRODS Consortium that drives its development and support."
