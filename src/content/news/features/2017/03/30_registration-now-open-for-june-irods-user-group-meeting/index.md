Users of the integrated Rule Oriented Data System (iRODS) from around the globe will gather in Utrecht, The Netherlands to discuss iRODS-enabled applications and discoveries, technologies powered by iRODS, and the future of iRODS and the iRODS Consortium.

Thousands of businesses<a href="https://renci.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/iRODS-UGM-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-16263 size-medium" src="https://renci.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/iRODS-UGM-2-300x159.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="159" /></a>, research centers, and government agencies located in the U.S., Europe, Asia, Australia, South America, and Africa use iRODS for flexible, policy-based data management that provides long-term preservation and federation.



The 9th iRODS User Group Meeting begins Tuesday, June 13 with two optional one-day training sessions aimed at beginner and advanced iRODS users. The iRODS User Group Meeting (UGM) will follow on June 14 and 15. The last day of early bird registration for the training sessions is May 1. More information, including a registration form, can be found at <a href="https://irods.org/ugm2017/">https://irods.org/ugm2017/</a>.

The UGM will offer more than 25 presentations from the user community and the core iRODS development team, including use case presentations, live demonstrations, and open discussions about requested iRODS features. The iRODS team anticipates an audience of about 150 participants representing academic, government, and commercial institutions.

Attendees will have the chance to present their iRODS stories in a variety of ways:
<ul>
 	<li>20-minute presentations that explain a novel iRODS application or development</li>
 	<li>40-minute talks/demonstrations that offer an explanation of an iRODS use case along with a live demonstration of the technology.</li>
</ul>
Presenters must submit an abstract by May 1. They are also encouraged to submit a paper for publication in the formal <em>Proceedings of the iRODS User Group Meeting 2017</em>, which will be made available as a PDF and on Amazon. Papers must be submitted by June 1.

Details on submitting content can be found at <a href="https://irods.org/ugm2017/cfp/">https://irods.org/ugm2017/cfp/</a>.
