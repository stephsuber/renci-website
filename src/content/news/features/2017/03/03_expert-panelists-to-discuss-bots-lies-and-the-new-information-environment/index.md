<em>The March 9 webcast is free and open to all.</em>

The explosion of social media, blogs, and websites purporting to be news sources, along with a 24-hour news cycle and ubiquitous assess to the internet from cell phones and other devices, means a new information environment. That environment is radically different from the days when we depended on the New York Times and local newspapers for information, and it is rewriting the norms of social interaction, conversation, public discourse, and news reporting.

The South Big Data Innovation Hub will bring together four experts for a roundtable discussion that explores how bots and other new phenomena are shaping conversations and shifting public discourse. The impact of these technologies and social media platforms can build bridges among groups who might not otherwise connect and promote positive change. However, those same tools can be harnessed to spread misinformation or used by terrorist groups. The Brookings Institution, for example, estimates ISIS has more than 70,000 Twitter accounts.

The roundtable discussion Anti-Social Computing: Bots, Lies, and the New Information Environment will be webcast from noon – 1:15 p.m. Thursday, March 9. The webcast is free and open to all. The public can also attend the roundtable in person at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
