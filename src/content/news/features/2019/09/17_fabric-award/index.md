<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Collaboration will establish a nationwide network infrastructure</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill will lead a $20
million project to create a platform for testing novel
internet architectures that could enable a faster, more secure
Internet. 
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With leadership from
researchers at the Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI),
UNC-Chapel Hill and its partners will build a platform, called
<a href="http://www.fabric-testbed.net/">FABRIC</a>,
to provide a nationwide testbed for reimagining how data can be
stored, computed and moved through shared infrastructure. FABRIC,
funded by the National Science Foundation, will allow scientists to
explore what a new Internet could look like at scale, and help
determine the internet architecture of the future.

<p>The Internet is a
global network of computers that communicate information back and
forth, powering the worldwide web and all online devices and
activities. A series of government-funded programs from the 1960s
through the 1980s established the computer networking architectures
that formed the basis for today’s Internet. FABRIC will help test
out new network designs that could overcome current bottlenecks and
continue to extend the Internet’s broad benefits for science and
society. FABRIC will explore the balance between the amount of
information a network maintains, the network’s ability to process
information, and its scalability, performance and security. 
</p>

<p>“The Internet has
been a great enabler for many science disciplines and in people’s
everyday lives, but it is showing its age and limitations, especially
when it comes to processing large amounts of data. If computer
scientists were to start over today, knowing what they now know, the
Internet might be designed in a different way,” said Ilya Baldin,
director of Network Research &amp; Infrastructure at RENCI, who will
serve as one of five principal investigators on the project.

<p>“FABRIC represents
large-scale network infrastructure where the Internet can be
reimagined, and a variety of ideas can be tried out and compared. If
FABRIC allows the research community to come up with ideas on how to
reimagine the Internet based on a new set of architectural tradeoffs,
then everybody wins – researchers and citizens alike.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today’s Internet
was not designed for the massive data sets, machine learning tools,
advanced sensors and Internet of Things devices that have become
central to many research and business endeavors. FABRIC will give
computer scientists a place to test networking and cybersecurity
solutions that can better capitalize on these tools and potentially
extend the Internet’s benefits to people in remote or underserved
areas. 
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As lead, RENCI will
oversee the effort while also contributing to software development,
supporting hardware deployment and assisting with outreach efforts. 
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The Network
Research and Infrastructure Group at RENCI is an incredibly
influential team of researchers, and this award demonstrates their
efforts to ensure that continuing research in fundamental networking
principles is available to all,” said Stan Ahalt, director of
RENCI. 
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Solving
complicated problems today requires sophisticated data science, which
is more than data management and analytics,” Ahalt said. “Data
transport and data security are also vital, and the FABRIC project
showcases RENCI’s impact on the fundamental infrastructure of data
science by working toward creating new mechanisms to transport data
quickly, efficiently, and securely.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>FABRIC will consist
of storage, computational and network hardware nodes connected by
dedicated high-speed optical links. In addition to the interconnected
deeply-programmable core nodes deployed across the country, FABRIC
nodes will include major national research facilities such as
universities, national labs and supercomputing centers that generate
and process enormous scientific data sets. Such flexibility and
control over the network functionality will allow experimenters to
test new architectures not possible today. All major aspects of the
FABRIC infrastructure will be programmable, so researchers can create
new configurations or tailor the platform for specific research
purposes, such as cybersecurity. 
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We don’t know
what’s the right balance between smarts, or how self-knowledgeable
the Internet needs to be, and scalability and performance,” said
Baldin. “What we are offering is an instrument where these
questions can be studied and researchers can make real progress
toward envisioning the Internet of the future.”</p>

Collaborating organizations include the University of Kentucky, the
Department of Energy’s Energy Sciences Network, Clemson University
and the Illinois Institute of Technology. Contributors from the
University of Kentucky and Energy Sciences Network will be
instrumental in designing and deploying the platform’s hardware and
developing new software. Clemson and Illinois Institute of Technology
researchers will work with a wide variety of user
communities—including those focused on security, distributed
architectures, scientific applications, and data transfer
protocols—to ensure FABRIC can serve their needs. In addition,
researchers from many other universities will help test the platform
and integrate their computing infrastructure and scientific
instruments into FABRIC. 
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The construction
phase of the project is expected to last four years, with the first
year dedicated to software development, finalizing technical designs,
and prototyping. Subsequent years will focus on rolling out the
platform’s hardware to participating sites across the nation and
connecting it to major national computing facilities. Ultimately,
experimenter communities will be able to attach new instruments or
hardware resources to FABRIC’s uniquely extensible design, allowing
the infrastructure to grow and adapt to changing research needs over
time.</p>
