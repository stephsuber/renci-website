<p>The
<a href="https://irods.org/">iRODS
Consortium</a>, the foundation
that leads development and support of the integrated Rule-Oriented
Data System (iRODS) data management software, welcomes University of
Colorado Boulder (CU Boulder) Research Computing as its newest
Consortium member. 
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/rc/">CU
Boulder Research Computing</a>
provides computing and data beyond the desktop to CU Boulder
researchers and students. This includes large-scale computing
resources, storage of research data, high-speed data transfer, data
sharing support, and consultations in computational science and data
management.&nbsp;</p>

<p>iRODS
is free open source software for data discovery, workflow automation,
secure collaboration, and data virtualization used by research and
business organizations around the globe. By creating a unified
namespace and a metadata catalog of all the data and users within the
storage environment, the iRODS rule engine framework allows users to
automate data management.</p>

<p>“CU
Boulder brings a unique use case to the iRODS Consortium,” said
Jason Coposky, Executive Director, iRODS Consortium. “Whereas data
quotas are usually implemented per data storage technology, CU
Boulder aims to implement a logical quota system that is based on the
usage of data within particular collections, in other words, limiting
the number of data objects that are allowed to reside in a data
collection based on metadata and the size of the collection. We
believe iRODS is well positioned to meet this unique need.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>CU
Boulder Research Computing plans to use iRODS to centrally manage the
allocation of its data storage resources while also supporting the
specific metadata requirements established by various user groups.
Ultimately, they hope iRODS can be used to abstract the data storage
namespace from the underlying storage infrastructure such that
changes to the infrastructure will remain largely invisible to end
users.

<p>Jonathon
Anderson, Associate Director of Research Computing Technology at CU
Boulder, expressed his hope that iRODS will become the primary
interface to CU Boulder’s storage infrastructure and allow users to
benefit from community standards for data management. 
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“I
consider it a primary value for us to support the development of open
and community-focused infrastructure,” said Anderson. “We are a
consortium member primarily towards assuring we would have incident
and break/fix support in our production iRODS environment, but also
to support the continued development and support of an environment
that we are adopting as a dependency.”</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The
iRODS Consortium guides development and support of iRODS, along with
providing production-ready iRODS distribution and iRODS professional
integration services, training, and support. The consortium is
administered by founding member&nbsp;<a href="https://renci.org/">RENCI</a>,
a research institute for applications of cyberinfrastructure located
at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unc.edu/">University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Upcoming
releases of the software will offer full text indexing and data
publication capabilities, Coposky noted.

<p>In
addition to CU Boulder Research Computing, current members of the
iRODS Consortium include Bayer,
Cloudian, DataDirect Networks,
Maastricht
University, MSC, the U.S. National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NetApp, Quantum, RENCI,
SURF, the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing, SUSE, Texas
Advanced Computing Center (TACC), University College London,
University of Groningen, Utrecht University, the Wellcome Sanger
Institute, and Western Digital.</p>
