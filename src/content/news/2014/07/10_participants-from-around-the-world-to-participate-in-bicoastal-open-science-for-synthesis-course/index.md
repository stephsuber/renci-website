CHAPEL HILL, NC and SANTA BARBARA, CA - A unique training course that will take place simultaneously on both U.S. coasts will get underway July 21 at RENCI headquarters in Chapel Hill, NC, and at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Open Science for Synthesis (OSS) is aimed at early career scientists who want to learn new software and technology skills needed for open, collaborative, and reproducible synthesis research. The three-week intensive program will run through August 8, with 45 participants who completed a competitive application process participating in the program.

During the three-week, bicoastal training, OSS participants will receive hands-on guided experience from a dynamic group of instructors assembled to provide a mixture of instructive lectures, discussions forums, exercises, and real-world application of skills to collaborative group synthesis research projects.

Participants who complete the program will gain direct experience and a greater understanding of best practices in the technical aspects that underlie successful open science and synthesis—from data discovery and integration to analysis and visualization. They will also learn techniques for collaborative scientific research, including virtual collaboration over the Internet.

Congratulations to all participants, who will travel to both course locations from sites around the globe.
